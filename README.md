# Employee_Tracker

## Overview

This project, I was to use mysql and the inquirer package to dynamically generate an employee database. The user is to use command line or terminal after cloning the repo, installing the packages with "npm install", and enter "node employeeTrack.js". This will give users a series of options: view all employees, view all departments, view all positions, add an employee, and update a position.

The database is employee database is linked to the prompts for the user to work with the employee database directly. This app can help companies search through the database and manipulate their data.
